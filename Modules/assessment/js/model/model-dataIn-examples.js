// Differences with SAP2012
/*
 - calc.occupancy: SAP calculates occupancy from total floor area, we allow input of custom occupancy
 - calc.fabric: According to SAP2012 (p,26 note2) a solar access factor of 1.0 [...] should be used for roof lights, but we think that is not right (see issue 237: https://github.com/emoncms/MyHomeEnergyPlanner/issues/237 
 - calc.ventilation: ventilation loses in SAP is calculated from the loses due to infiltration and ventilation system (see calculation of 25m in worksheets). OpenBEM keeps those loses separated and calls them: ventilation loses (due to ventilation system) and infiltratioon loses 
 - calc.ventilation: despite SAP doesn't make a difference between ventilation and infiltration loses, the loses due to Extract Ventilation Points (intermittent fans and passive vents) is in the part of the formula that corresponds with "infiltration". OpenBEM considers them to be loses due to the ventilation system. GIT issue 177: https://github.com/emoncms/MyHomeEnergyPlanner/issues/177)
 - calc.ventilation: SAP does has a magnificient mistake when calculating the Infiltration Rate if a pressurisation test has been carried out. Formula 18 in worksheet adds q50 (cubic meters per hour per square meter of envelope area) with ACH (air changes per hour). In the case of using q50 we first convert it from cubic meter per... to ACH and then calculate the infiltration rate (ACH)
 - calc.ventilation: SAP only considers 4 type of ventilation systems:
 - a: Balanced mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR)
 - b: Balanced mechanical ventilation without heat recovery (MV)
 - c: Whole house extract ventilation or positive input ventilation from outside
 - d: Natural ventilation or whole house positive input ventilation from loft
 But OpenBEM considers 7
 - NV: natural ventilation (type 'd' in SAP)
 - IE: Intermittent Extract Ventilations (type 'd' in SAP)
 - PS: Passive Stack (type 'd' in SAP)
 - DEV: Decentralised continous mechanical extract ventilation (type 'c' in SAP)
 - MEV: Mechanical Continuous Extract Ventilation (type 'c' in SAP)
 - MV: Balanced Mechanical Ventilations without heat recovery (type 'b' in SAP)
 - MVHR: Balanced mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (type 'a' in SAP)
 - calc.temperature: SAP assumes specific periods with heating off in week or weekend days (table 9). OpenBEM allows the user to define the number and length of the periods
 - data.total_cost, data.primary_energy_use and data.annualco2: SAP doesn't take into account the energy used for appliances and cooking for the calculations of total cost, primary energy and co2 emissions. OpenBEM does
 - When using SAP calculation for LAC: 
 - the energy requirements for cooking are calculated from the CO2 emssions applying a emission factor of 0.519 (assuming cooking is done with electricity. 
 - OpenBEM has energy_efficient_appliances as input. When set to true: reduced internal heat gains are asssumed (as per SAP) and also a coefficient of 0.9 is applied in the calculation of the annual energy used for appliances
 - OpenBem allows to calculate energy requirements, gains and CO2 for LAC inputing a detailed list of items with info about the power they use, efficiency and time of use. This method can be more accurate than SAP
 - OpenBem allows to calculate energy requirements, gains and CO2 for Appliances and Cooking using items from a Carbon Co-op library. This method can be more accurate than SAP
 - OpenBEM allows to override the SAP calculation for annual energy content of hot water
