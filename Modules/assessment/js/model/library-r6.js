Insulating will change the conditions of the sub-floor space, which may increase the risk of damp and rot. The existing condition of the sub-floor and floor joists should be carefully inspected, and it should be ensured that an adequate amount of ventilation is provided to the sub-floor - by un-blocking air-bricks or introducing new ones. If joists are thinner than insulation, may be necessary to under-draw floor with more rigid (but still breathable) insulating board. ",
